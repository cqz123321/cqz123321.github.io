title: VBTS Performance Evaluation Pipeline
summary: "This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework for quantitatively analyzing VBTS performance, addressing challenges from varying sensing mechanisms and structures. We define key performance metrics relevant to application scenarios and design an experimental pipeline for structured assessment. Applying this framework to multiple VBTSs demonstrates its effectiveness in evaluating multifunctionality and providing precise quantitative indicators. This helps researchers select suitable VBTSs and optimize their design for specific tasks."

Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in robotic tasks, which is attributed to their high spatial resolution and relatively low manufacturing costs. In current research, variations in sensing mechanisms, structural dimensions, and other parameters among different VBTS lead to significant performance disparities. This diversity creates challenges for users to optimize VBTS for specific tasks, as the initial choice and subsequent fine-tuning can be hindered by a lack of standardized metrics. To address this issue, this study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework for the quantitative analysis of VBTS performance. We first define a set of performance metrics tailored to typical application scenarios, specifically chosen to represent key quantitative characteristics of VBTS. For each metric, we design an experimental pipeline that provides a structured framework for performance quantification. This evaluation approach is then applied to multiple VBTSs based on different sensing principles to conduct performance assessments. The experimental results demonstrate that this framework provides a thorough evaluation of VBTS multifunctionality and offers precise quantitative indicators for each performance dimension. This supports researchers in pre-selecting appropriate VBTS for specific tasks and provides performance-guided insights for optimizing the design of VBTS
