In this project, we independently developed a high-performance robotic hand, integrating the Digit tactile sensor and pioneering a custom-designed flexible skin to enhance its tactile sensing capabilities. Unlike conventional robotic hands, our system features a self-developed flexible elastomer embedded with marker tracking and contour recognition algorithms, enabling real-time monitoring of surface deformations and contact interactions.
Through these innovations, we achieved precise force control and grasp angle regression, allowing the robotic hand to dynamically adjust its grip strength and orientation based on external stimuli. This capability ensures safe and intelligent human-machine interaction, significantly reducing the risk of excessive force application and improving grasping adaptability across various object shapes and sizes.
Our approach not only enhances robotic dexterity and safety but also paves the way for advanced applications in assistive robotics, industrial automation, and human-centered robotic systems. By combining cutting-edge tactile sensing with real-time control algorithms, we have laid a strong foundation for the next generation of intelligent robotic grasping and manipulation.
