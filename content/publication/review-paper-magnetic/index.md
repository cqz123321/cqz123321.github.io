abstract: |
Magnetic microrobots, with their small size and agile maneuverability, are well-suited for navigating the intricate and confined spaces within the human body. In vivo cargo delivery within the context of microrobotics involves the use of microrobots to transport and administer drugs and cells directly to the targeted regions within a living organism. The principal aim is to enhance the precision, efficiency, and safety of therapeutic interventions. Despite their potential, there is a shortage of comprehensive reviews on the use of magnetic microrobots for in vivo cargo delivery from both research and engineering perspectives, particularly those published after 2019. This review addresses this gap by disentangling recent advancements in magnetic microrobots for in vivo cargo delivery. It summarizes their actuation platforms, structural designs, cargo loading and release methods, tracking methods, navigation algorithms, and degradation and retrieval methods. Finally, it highlights potential research directions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the current landscape of magnetic microrobot technologies for in vivo cargo delivery. It highlights their present implementation methods, capabilities, and prospective research directions. The review also examines significant innovations and inherent challenges in biomedical applications.
