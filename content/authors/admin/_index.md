I completed my undergraduate studies at Durham University in 2022, specializing in Mechanical Engineering. My dissertation project applied the Stochastic Newmark Method to analyze earthquake impacts on skyscrapers and large structures, building my expertise in structural dynamics and computational analysis.

In 2023, I earned an MSc in Biorobotics from the University of Bristol, where my research involved developing a soft, reconfigurable robotic hand for advanced in-hand manipulation. This project enhanced my skills and interest in bio-inspired robotics and sophisticated manipulation techniques.

Following my master's, I pursued an internship at the Multi-Scale Embodied Intelligence Lab at Imperial College London, known for pioneering work in micro-robotics, tactile perception, and teleoperation control. During this internship, I gained extensive hands-on experience in micro robot manufacturing and operation. I was deeply involved in the fabrication and performance evaluation of Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTS), as well as the advanced analysis and practical application of image-based tactile sensing data. Additionally, I designed and implemented flexible PCBs specifically tailored for robotic sensor integration. My responsibilities also included leveraging deep learning techniques for comprehensive data management, encompassing data acquisition, preprocessing, analysis, and interpretation.
