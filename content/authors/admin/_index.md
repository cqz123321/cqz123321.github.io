I completed my undergraduate studies at Durham University in 2022, where I specialized in Mechanical Engineering. My dissertation project was centered on the application of the Stochastic Newmark Method for analyzing the impact of earthquakes on skyscrapers and other large structures. Following this, in 2023, I obtained my Master's degree from the University of Bristol, with a focus on MSc Biorobotics. My research dissertation was dedicated to the development of a soft and reconfigurable robotic hand designed for in-hand manipulation tasks. This project sparked my profound interest in the cutting-edge field of Robotics.

Driven by my passion for research in Robotics, I pursued an internship at the Multi-Scale Embodied Intelligence Lab at Imperial College, renowned for their innovative contributions to micro robotics, tactile perception and teleoperation control. This experience has significantly enriched my understanding and skills in the domain, fueling my enthusiasm to contribute to the advancement of Robotics.
